Automata - Experiments with Neural Particle Automata
====================================================
Experiments with generalizing neural cellular automata (NCA) to dynamic point clouds using graph convolutional networks. The model is trained to parameterize a nonlinear recurrence relation that, provided an initial "seed" state, converges in finite time to a unique target configuration via local message propagation.
