Automata - Experiments with Neural Particle Automata
====================================================
The source code for neural particle automata, a generalization of neural cellular automata to dynamic point clouds using graph convolutional networks. The model is trained to parameterize a nonlinear recurrence relation that, provided an initial "seed" state, converges to a unique target configuration using local message propagation.
