Automata - Experiments with Neural Particle Automata
====================================================
The source code for neural particle automata, a generalization of neural cellular automata to dynamic point clouds using graph convolutional networks. The model is trained to parameterize a nonlinear recurrence relation that, given some initial "seed" configuration, converges to a target configuration using local message propagation.
